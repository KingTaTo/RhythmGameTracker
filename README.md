# RhythmGameTracker
A score tracker/viewer for (hopefully) various rhythm games.
If you're on an online tracker, then what are you doing here lol, go use that instead.

## IIDX
To view scores, find the appropriate ```.db``` file
- for asphyxia peeps, ```contents/savedata/iidx@asphyxia.db```

## Chunithm
- If using aqua, ```data/db.sqlite```
